I have been programming since i was 7 years old and have professionally developed games now for 8 years.  
Most of my time I spend on working with the server side of games. Ranging from the entire enviroment to the programming.

I have worked in PHP, JavaScript, Python and Java. Today I programm most of the day in C#, either in Unity or .NET.

I love working on complex projects that challenge everyone involved and can bring a strong technical leadership to the team.

I care especially about the performance, testability, maintainability, simplicity and usability in the projects i work on.

Currently i work at [Bright Future GmbH](https://www.brightfuture.de)
